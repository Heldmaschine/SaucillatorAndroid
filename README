This is a very unstable project as I'm constantly messing with it.

This is a basic audio synth engine for Android. Based on pieces of Adam Smith's Ethereal Dialpad and other various projects, this is my first attempt at creating a DAC as well as an Android application. The 'Saucillator' concept is the idea of using various input devices (touchpad/screen, accelerometer, etc) to transform your device into an instrument (inspired in part by the Kaosscilator). The original prototype was done for the Macbook Pro trackpad using Java and JSyn library. It can be found in my other repos. This is my attempt at transforming that type of application to Android.
